FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. 
It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are--

Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application
